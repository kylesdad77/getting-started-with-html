<h2>Important Concepts</h2>

<b>How the internet works</b>
<p>A user connects to the internet with their computer. 
  The internet is basically a bunch of computers connected
  to servers. The internet sends an <i>HTTP</i> signal to the servers. The servers send the info back to the computer.
A web browser like <i>I.E., Firefox</i> or <i>Google Chrome,</i> then turns the HTML text
  into a docutment that can be viewed on your monitor. The internet is basically a collection of HTML text documents.</p>
<b>Basics of HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is the programming language that allows someone to write code for web pages. This is the "heart" of the web. It is made up of text content. <em>What you see</em> It is also made up of markup. <em>What it looks like.</em> You can reference other documents, create links to other web pages and imbed videos.
</p>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p>There are many tags that can change the look of your webpage. A tag looks like this: <i>(opening tag name, contents, closing tag name)</i> This is done with < > instead of ( ) of course. 
  A few of the tags consist of the em tag which <em>italicizes</em> text. The b tag which <b>bolds</b> text. There is also a u tag which <u>underlines</u> text. There are just a few of the many tags available in the HTML language. You can also assign attributes which are values that can link certain web pages to text. Click <a href="udacity.com">here</a> to go to Udacity.com. This is an "a" tag which are anchors for linking webpages.
</p>
<b>Computers are stupid?</b>
<p>I always thought computers were smart until I learned a neat little tidbit from this course. Computers can only do what we tell them to do. We must program them to do the tasks which we require and we must program them correctly. One syntax error can cause an entire program to not function. Syntax errors and simply errors in what was entered into the code.</p>
<b>Whitespace</b>
<p>White space refers to the way text looks on a webpage when it is entered as HTML. The text will form one long line without proper formatting. A br tag can be used to add a <br>line break. This is a void tag meaning it does not require a closing tag. This is referred to as an "inline" element. It creates changes on a line without creating a box.</p> 
<p>The p tags creats new paragraphs.</p>This is referred to as a "block" element. It creates an invisible box around the text that has actual height and width.
